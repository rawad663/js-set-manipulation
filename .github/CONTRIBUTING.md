## Contributions
- Noticed something wrong in the code?
- Saw something that can be improved
- Thought of a new feature that would be cool to have?

This project welcomes all contributions, here's a few ways how:
  * Opening an Issue
  * Contributing Code
  * Documentation

### Opening Issues
If you find what you think is an issue, don't hesitate to create one explaning the problem (the more detail, the better). 
When reporting an issue we also need as much information about your environment that you can include. We never know what information will be useful when trying narrow down the issue. Please include at least the following information:

  * Version of js-set-manipulation
  * Platform you're running on (macOS, SmartOS, Linux, Windows)
  * Architecture you're running on (32bit or 64bit and x86 or ARM)
  
### Contributing Code
If you would like to fix a bug mentioned on the issues tab, or a new feature you think could be useful, feel free to fork the project and create your solution. When it's done and properly tested, create a pull request into this repo's `master` branch.

### Writing Tests
Writing tests for the project helps make the package safer from unwanted changes and a more robust
library to use.

If you wish to write a test for a function, please ensure the following:
* The setup for that function has been properly done.
* You've properly asserted the expected value of that function call.
* You've tested that changing the expected value fails your test.
* Your test handles and checks all outcomes of that function.

Then simply submit a PR with that test :)
Checkout [the testing page](.github/TESTING.md) for more info one how tests
work in the project.


### Documentation
Documentation is important to keep the users up to date with what's available in the package. If you would like to contribute to the documentation of the project, same process as code contributions(above) applies.
