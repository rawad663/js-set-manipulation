### Opening Issues
If you find what you think is an issue, don't hesitate to create one explaning the problem (the more detail, the better). 
When reporting an issue we also need as much information about your environment that you can include. We never know what information will be useful when trying narrow down the issue. Please include at least the following information:

  * Version of js-set-manipulation
  * Platform you're running on (macOS, SmartOS, Linux, Windows)
  * Architecture you're running on (32bit or 64bit and x86 or ARM)
